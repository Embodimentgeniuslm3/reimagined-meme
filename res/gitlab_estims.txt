Used gitdm on gitlab repo to get summary num of authors and commits in 2016-05 - 2017-04
Used report from gitlab for last 2 months and also just counted merge requests
and issues for last year manually (on their site)

This is an estimate, maybe we can get better data when using GitLab API?

New round 2016-06-01 - 2017-06-01:

Their repo is: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/`, clone it via: `git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce.git` in `~/dev/` directory.
Their repo hosted by GitHub is: `https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq`
Their bug tracker is `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues`, just count issues in given date range
Issues: There are 732 pages of issues (20 on page) = 14640 issues
To count PRs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests?scope=all&state=all
Merge Requests: 371,5 page = 7430

To count authors run in gitlab-ce directory:
git log --since "2016-06-01" --until "2017-06-01" --pretty=format:"%aE" | sort | uniq | wc -l --> 575
git log --since "2016-05-01" --until "2017-05-01" --pretty=format:"%aE" | sort | uniq | wc -l --> 589
